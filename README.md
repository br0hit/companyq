# Description

There are many GitHub repositories that provide CSV files containing LeetCode questions for each company. This project takes that concept further by building a website where:

Questions repeated across different companies are tracked more effectively compared to traditional CSV or Excel lists.

Topic-wise solving and progress tracking for each company is made simpler and more organized.

The goal is to make interview preparation easier, more visual, and interactive â€” moving beyond static spreadsheets into a centralized online platform.
Company wise questions accessibility and tracking
